[b]Massive February update![/b]

[h1]Discord[/h1]
[list]
[*] We made our very own[url=https://discord.gg/vYbu7CqpQX]Left 4 Legend Discord server[/url] to make player communication easier than ever.
[*] Discord is fully integrated into the servers â€” each server has a dedicated text channel with a [b]two-way connection between Discord and the servers[/b].
[i]For example, messages sent from the text channel of server #1 in Discord will be visible in the chat to everyone playing, as well as chat messages sent by players on server #1 will be visible to everyone in the text channel of server #1 in Discord.[/i]

[*] [url=https://Bans.L4L.su]Global ban system[/url] has been integrated into the servers.
[*] Meaning, any player banned on any of the Left 4 Legend servers will be banned from every other Left 4 Legend server instantaneously.
[*] Bans monitoring website: [url=https://Bans.L4L.su]Bans.L4L.su[/url]

[h1]The servers[/h1]
[list]
[*] The Witch can incapacitate multiple Survivors in-range of her claws swing (in Realism, Survivors hit by the Witch's claws AoE are incapacited instead of being killed instantly).
[*] Adrenaline shot can be administered to an incapacitated Survivor for him to get up more quickly and get the benefits of an adrenaline shot immediately. To do that, simply equip your adrenaline shot and start helping an incapacitated Survivor.
[*] Survivor bots no longer cause camera shake when shooting through Survivor players.
[*] Carryable explosives (gas cans, propane tanks, oxygen tanks) detonate in hands from friendly fire.
[*] A weapon is considered reloaded when the mag is fully inserted visually, instead of having to wait for the [i]reload animation[/i] to finish (timed for vanilla weapon animations).
[*] A weapon is reloaded upon picking up explosive/incendiary ammunition.
[*] A weapon is re-equipped upon installing laser sights.
[*] Missing shotgun firing sounds when in third person are restored.
